# Feature Specification: CodeRabbit Comment Fetcher MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-mvp-that-pulls`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "mvp that pulls ALL unresolved coderabbit comments from a PR to be reviewed by claude code using command"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (developer using Claude Code), actions (fetch comments, display for review), data (CodeRabbit PR comments), constraints (unresolved only)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Comments, PR, threads
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A developer working on a pull request receives CodeRabbit review comments and wants to address them efficiently. They want to retrieve all unresolved CodeRabbit comments from their current PR branch in a format that Claude Code can analyze and help them address systematically.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer is on a branch with an associated PR containing unresolved CodeRabbit comments, **When** they run the command, **Then** all unresolved CodeRabbit comments are displayed with file paths and comment text

2. **Given** a developer is on a branch with an associated PR that has no unresolved CodeRabbit comments, **When** they run the command, **Then** a success message indicates no unresolved comments exist

3. **Given** a developer is on a branch without an associated PR, **When** they run the command, **Then** an error message indicates no PR was found for the current branch

4. **Given** a developer is not in a git repository, **When** they run the command, **Then** an error message indicates the command must be run from within a git repository

5. **Given** CodeRabbit has posted comments on multiple files in a PR, **When** the developer runs the command, **Then** comments are grouped by file path for easy navigation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the PR has hundreds of unresolved comments? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be pagination or output limits?]
- How does the system handle CodeRabbit comments in nested conversation threads?
- What happens if GitHub authentication fails or expires?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from GitHub API?
- What happens when a PR has been closed or merged?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST auto-detect the current git repository's owner and name from the working directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST auto-detect the PR number associated with the current branch
- **FR-003**: System MUST fetch all review threads from the detected PR
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter review threads to only include unresolved threads
- **FR-005**: System MUST filter comments within unresolved threads to only show comments authored by CodeRabbit (login: "coderabbitai")
- **FR-006**: System MUST display each comment with its associated file path
- **FR-007**: System MUST display each comment's text content in readable format
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle pagination when fetching review threads (PRs may have more than 100 threads)
- **FR-009**: System MUST display a friendly message when no unresolved CodeRabbit comments are found
- **FR-010**: System MUST display clear error messages when prerequisites are not met (no PR, not in repo, authentication failure)
- **FR-011**: System MUST use existing GitHub CLI authentication (no separate credential management)
- **FR-012**: System MUST support standard terminal output with visual formatting (emojis, spacing)
- **FR-013**: System MUST exit with code 0 on success, 1 on user error, 2 on system error

### Key Entities

- **Pull Request**: The GitHub pull request being reviewed, identified by owner, repo name, and PR number
- **Review Thread**: A conversation thread containing one or more comments, has an `isResolved` status
- **Comment**: Individual review comment within a thread, has author, body text, file path, and creation timestamp
- **Repository Context**: Current working directory's git repository information (owner, name, current branch)
